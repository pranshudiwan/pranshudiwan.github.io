## Welcome!

### About me

I'm a final year undergraduate student at Mumbai University, majoring in Information Technology. A Data Science enthusiast, curently interning as a Data Science Intern at Hashtag Loyalty.

My areas of interest include Natural Language Processing (working with problems like word sense disambiguation, pronoun resolution, summarization, etc.) Computer Vision, and understanding and solving real life Data Science problems. 

I started solving competitions on Kaggle in my second year of undergraduate study. Starting from the very basic Titanic Survival prediction challenge to completing the Toxic Comments challenge with a bronze medal, it's been a long way.

Currently, I'm in my last semester of my undergrad and I'm applying to masters programs for the fall '19 intake.

## Projects:

Here are some of the projects I've worked upon during my undergrad. 

- **[Item Classification](https://github.com/pranshudiwan/Classify-food-items-Unsupervised-learning-)** `Code`

 _I have classified a database of food items into appropriate segments (veg, non-veg, drinks, etc) using an **unsupervised approach**, since there are no features in our data, only (item_id, item_name)._

_I have used Word2Vec, SpaCy, GloVe and cosine similarity matrices._ 
 
 - **[Web application for database operations](https://github.com/pranshudiwan/Search-and-CRUD-Database-Operations-on-a-web-app)** `Code`
 
 _Extension of my project at Hexaware Technologies Ltd. It can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on any database on a web app. Added a module to import a external database as a csv file which directly gets added/updated to the main database after validation. Also added a new custom self-designed CSS3 theme._
 
 - **[Toxic comments classification challenge (Kaggle)](https://github.com/pranshudiwan/Toxic-comments-challenge)** `Code`
 
 _Built a model capable of detecting different types of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate. Trained an ensemble model consisting of algorithms like LSTM, Attention Model, Glove embedding using Keras to get an accuracy score of 0.9865 on
the leaderboard._ 
 
 - **[Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/pranshudiwan/Personalised-movie-recommendation-system)** `Code`
 
 _Built an ensemble model for a personalized movie recommendation system. The ensemble model has content based, popularity based and
collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms. Used the MovieLens datasets._
